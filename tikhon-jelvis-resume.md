# Experience

## Principal Data Scientist | Target | Oct 2019–now

<!-- Describe demand forecasting: different granularities, operations, planning -->

<!-- Consumer Demand Forecasting is an effort to accurately estimate expected demand for products at various (geo)locations and timeperiods, which is critical for planning and operating purposes of a retail business -->

  * Tech lead on large-scale deep learning model for demand forecasting
    * Day-granularity forecasts for 100k SKUs x 2000 Target stores x 14 weeks (20B forecasts)
    * Trained embeddings used for similarity, clustering and training explainable forecasting models
  * Developed store similarity API based on embeddings from deep learning model
    * Created first-of-a-kind item-store demand-based clustering model, used for assortment planning
  * Led refactor/redesign + containerization for demand forecasting model training
  * Created system requirements for new AI infrastructure across the AI teams at Target
  * Mentored teams working on new-item forecast and forecast training scalability
    * Guided architecture + system design

<!-- Split principal role into three larger sub-sections: demand forecasting, architecture/team, evangalizing -->

<!-- Evangalized new technologies to the team  -->
<!-- Example: property-based testing, which helped several teams prevent bugs from getting into production  -->
<!-- Another example... -->

## Lead Data Scientist | Target | Jul 2016–Oct 2019

  * Designed three generations of Target's multi-echelon inventory control simulation
    * Scaled to support sales and operations planning for ≈30% of Target's inventory
    * Improved SKU availability by 50bps
    * Detected supply chain defects ahead of time
    * Supported scenario planning for events like COVID or extreme weather
    * Runtime performance improved by 15–20x across generations
  * Led software design for warehouse operations simulation
    * Simulated scenarios for new automation in Perth-Amboy flow center
    * Evolved into labor planning tool for 30+ Target distribution centers
  * Motivated team to define explicit protocols between components
    * Saved the team hours of work each week on deploying pipelines
    * Wrote interface description language to help overcome the team's initial friction: \github{target/theta-idl}
  * Taught multi-year course on functional programming and Haskell
