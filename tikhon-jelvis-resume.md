# Experience

## Founding Software Engineer | CXScore | Jan 2023–Present

  * Built Python framework for running ML models against live web pages
  * Developed accessibility tests using the Python framework + LLMs
  * Expanded framework for automated testing of native mobile apps
  * Wrote backend services for all of our Python-based accessibility tests

## Principal Engineer | Target | Oct 2019–Jun 2022

<!-- Describe demand forecasting: different granularities, operations, planning -->

<!-- Consumer Demand Forecasting is an effort to accurately estimate expected demand for products at various (geo)locations and timeperiods, which is critical for planning and operating purposes of a retail business -->

  * Engineering lead on large-scale deep learning model for demand forecasting (Python, Hadoop)
    * Day-granularity forecasts for 100k SKUs x 2000 Target stores x 14 weeks (20B forecasts)
    * Generated embeddings used for similarity, clustering and training explainable forecasting models
    * Put model into production with domain-specific APIs
  * Created system requirements for new AI infrastructure across the AI teams at Target
  * Mentored teams working on new-item forecast and forecast training scalability
    * Guided architecture + system design

## Lead Engineer | Target | Jul 2016–Oct 2019

  * Designed three generations of Target's multi-echelon inventory control simulation (Haskell, Rust)
    * Scaled to support sales and operations planning for ≈30% of Target's SKUs
    * Improved SKU availability across Target stores by 50bps
    * Detected supply chain defects ahead of time
    * Supported scenario planning for events like COVID or extreme weather
    * Improved runtime performance by 15–20x across generations
  * Led software design for warehouse operations simulation (Python)
    * Simulated scenarios for new automation in Perth-Amboy flow center
    * Evolved into labor planning tool for 30+ Target distribution centers
  * Led team to define explicit protocols between pipeline components
    * Saved hours of work each week when deploying pipelines
    * Designed interface description language to help overcome the team's initial friction: \github{target/theta-idl}
  * Taught multi-year course on functional programming and Haskell

## Software Engineer | Esper | Jul 2014–Oct 2015

  * Implemented OAuth, IMAP and GMail API in backend (OCaml)
  * Wrote Chrome extension that injected a tool bar + sidebar into GMail UI (TypeScript)
  * Prototyped Android app (Java)

## Research Assistant | Berkeley Par Lab | Aug 2012–Nov 2013

  * Implemented + evaluated algorithms to synthesize code for GA144 chips
  * Co-author on PLDI 2014 paper

## Tech Intern | Jane Street | Jun 2013–Aug 2013

  * Two OCaml projects: live data visualization tool + userland automount replacement
